# ARMBR
Version 1.0.0 

This repository is the original implementation of ARMBR:    
Artifact-Reference Multivariate Backward Regression (ARMBR) Outperforms Common EEG Blink Artifact Removal Methods

by Ludvik Alkhoury, Giacomo Scanavini, Samuel Louviot, Ana Radanovic, Sudhin A. Shah, and N. Jeremy Hill

Below, we provide instructions on how to: 
1) download the package 
2) implement the code in Matlab and Python

## Download Package
1) Select a directory to save this repository to. This can be done by creating a directory on your Desktop (for example: C:/MyPC/Desktop/GitRepo/).
Open the Git bash and type:
```
cd "C:/MyPC/Desktop/GitRepo/"
```

2) Download (clone) this repository in the directory that we previously created. This can be done by opening Git bash inside the directory we just created (for example: C:/MyPC/Desktop/GitRepo/) and typing:
```
git clone "https://github.com/S-Shah-Lab/ARMBR.git"
```
and then go the repository directory by typing:
```
cd ARMBR/
```

3) Now that you have the repository, run setup.py to install all dependent packages:
```
python -m pip install -e  ./Python
```
