ARMBR: Artifact-Reference Multivariate Backward Regression
===========================================================

Welcome to the official documentation of the **ARMBR** algorithm.

ARMBR (Artifact-Reference Multivariate Backward Regression) is a robust EEG blink artifact removal technique that works effectively with minimal calibration data and as few as two frontal electrodes (e.g., FP1 and FP2). It is well-suited for pediatric and clinical EEG where long recordings or dense montages may not be available.

.. note::
   ARMBR is designed to be compatible with both **MNE-Python** and **scikit-learn**, and it can be used as a standalone function or as a class object with `.fit()`, `.apply()`, and `.plot()` methods.

**Main Features**
-----------------

- Works with raw EEG signals, epochs, or preprocessed data
- Requires only reference channels for eye blinks (e.g., FP1/FP2)
- Minimal calibration data required (as little as 5â€“10 seconds)
- Compatible with pipelines based on MNE or scikit-learn
- Supports masking and visualization
- Fast and interpretable, no ICA or source modeling needed
